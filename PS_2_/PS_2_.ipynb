    "#### Using geologic data to determine plate velocities (direction and magnitude)\n",

    "7. Movement of the Pacific plate   \n",
    "    1. Use data from Seafloor age layer to calculate the rate at which the Pacific plate has been moving away from the East Pacific Rise over the last 100 million years or so.  Use the Ruler tool from the tool bar to measure distance, and give your answer in mm/yr or km/my (note that these will be the same number!)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now turn off the sea floor age layer and turn on the *Volcanic Chains* layer. This shows the ages of younger volcanic rocks of various oceanic islands and seamounts, formed by eruptions onto older seafloor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Within the *Volcanic Chains* layer, find the Hawaiian Island/Emperor seamount chain and the Louisville seamount chain (east of New Zealand), both on the Pacific plate.  Zoom in so that the numbers representing the ages of the rocks in the chain (in millions of years) are displayed.  Note the age progression of each chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assume that each of these chains is generated by a plume or “hot spot” underneath the Pacific plate.  The “hot spots” periodically erupt to form volcanic islands atop the older ocean floor. However, once an island is no longer above the hot spot, volcanism shuts off and the volcano is eroded to sea level (getting a flattish top), and final sinks below sea level as the lithosphere cools and contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We can explain the age progression of these island chains by either a plate moving over a stationary hot spot, or a moving hot spot under a stationary plate.  Let’s see which is supported by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Using the age progression of the Hawaiian Island/seamount chain, determine the implied velocity (remember that velocity includes both speed and direction) of a moving Pacific plate over the last 46.7 million years.\n",
    "    3. Do the same using data for the Louisville chain in the southern Pacific Ocean (on the Pacific plate east of New Zealand).\n",
    "    4. Compare the two volcanic chain data sets to the Seafloor age data set. Which is the best explanation:  the Pacific plate moving over fixed hot spots or a moving hot spots under a stationary Pacific plate?  Explain.\n",
    "    5. Now compare this data set to the Easter Island chain on the Nazca plate on the other side of the East Pacific Rise.  Does the implied velocity of the Nazca plate fit the plate tectonic model you are developing with the Pacific plate data? Explain.\n",
    "    6. If four independent data sets are good, five are even better, right?  Click on the GPS horizontal vectors layer.  These arrows show the horizontal component of the motion of GPS stations cemented into the ground, over the last decade or so. The length of the arrow is related to the speed (the longer, the faster).  Clicking on an arrow brings up a dialog box with the direction and magnitude of the motion, and a link to the time series from which this horizontal component is derived. Does the GPS data support your conclusions from above?  Explain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. The mid-Atlantic ridge and the Atlantic Ocean basin   \n",
    "    1. With the Seafloor age layer clicked on, and without doing any calculations, is the mid-Atlantic ridge spreading ocean faster or slower than the East Pacific Rise?  Explain.\n",
    "    2. Did the northern Atlantic Ocean basin begin opening at the same time as the southern Atlantic Ocean basin?   How much older or younger is the South "
