    "# Part I: Mineral Identification in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "While critical to defining and classifying minerals, the crystal structure of minerals (e.g. unit cell structure) and their chemical composition (e.g. NaCl for Halite) are not always practical parameters for identifying minerals. Instead, geologists rely on physical properties such as density, thermal characteristics (e.g. thermal conductivity, thermal expansion and specific heat), and elastic properties (e.g. shear and bulk modulus). Optical properties include color, polarization and birefringence, factors that are also considered when you buy your sunglasses! Each mineral has a unique set of physical and optical properties that can be utilized to determine its identity. \n",

    " \n",
    "In this tutorial, you will be introduced to some commonly used physical and optical properties in order to identify a set of minerals. We will first learn about some properties and then develop an approach for the identification of minerals based on this knowledge. The properties that we will discuss include color, cleavage, luster, hardness, density, streak, reactivity, magnetism, and mineral fluorescence. Pages 139-142 from the book *Earth: portrait of a planet*, 7<sup>th</sup> Edition, by Marshak is a good introductory reference, while Chapter 6 from *Manual of Mineralogy*, 21<sup>st</sup> Edition by Klein & Hurlbut is meant for advanced reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to correctly identify any mineral, you will need to learn more about each property. We have set up stations around the room which help to illustrate the main aspects of each of these properties. Below we have provided some basic information on each property. Your job is to go to each station, take notes, photos, and measurements, and log this information below. The information you add to this list will be used in the next section of this exercise, and in future problem sets. So please be thorough in your note-taking. You likely will reference these mineral properties many times during this course and beyond. \n",

    "Cleavage is one of the trickiest properties to understand. Cleavage is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural planes. If bonds between atoms are weaker in certain directions than in other directions, the crystal will tend to split along the weakly bonded planes. These flat breaks are termed \"cleavage\". Cleavage can come in many forms including Basal (1-cleavage plane), Prismatic (2-cleavage planes), Cubic (3-cleavage planes intersecting at 90 degrees), Rhombohedral (3-cleavage planes intersecting at angles that are **not** 90 degrees), Octahedral (4-cleavage planes), and many others. Below are examples of some of the most common types of cleavage. \n",
