    "# Part I: Physical Properties of Minerals\n",
    "\n",
    "While critical to defining and classifying minerals, measurements of the chemical composition or crystal structure of minerals are not always practical when identifying minerals. Instead, geologists rely on physical properties. Each mineral has a unique set of physical properties that can be utilized to determine its identity. **In this exercise**, you will be introduced to some commonly used physical properties in order to identify a set of minerals. We will first learn about some of these physical properties, then we will develop an approach for the identification of minerals using these physical properties. Among the properties, we will discuss color, cleavage, luster, hardness, density, streak, reactivity, magnetism, and mineral fluorescence. Pages 139-142 of Earth: portrait of a planet by Stephen Marshak is a good reference if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section A: Learning about Physical Properties \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** In order to correctly identify any mineral, you will need to learn more about each physical property. We have set up stations around the room which help to illustrate the main aspects of each of these physical properties. Below we have provided some basic information on each physical property. Your job is to go to each station, take notes, photos, and measurements, and log this information below. The information you add to this list will be used in the next section of this exercise, and PSET4. So be thorough in your note-taking. You likely will reference these mineral properties many times. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Color: \n",
    "Color is the easiest property to observe, but only a few minerals can be identified by color alone.  Elemental impurities can contaminate the mineral changing its color. For example, below we show how variable the color of quartz can be. \n",

    "### Cleavage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleavage is one of the trickiest properties to understand. Cleavage is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural planes. If bonds between atoms are weaker in certain directions than in other directions, the crystal will tend to split along the weakly bonded planes. These flat breaks are termed \"cleavage\". Cleavage can come in many forms including Basal (1-cleavage plane), Prismatic (2-cleavage planes), Cubic (3-cleavage planes intersecting at 90 degrees), Rhombohedral (3-cleavage planes intersecting at angles that are **not** 90 degrees), Octahedral (4-cleavage planes), and many others. Below are examples of some of the most common types of cleavage. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Luster:\n",
    "\n",
    "Luster is the appearance of a mineral surface in terms of its light-reflective qualities. Luster depends upon a mineral’s refractive power, degree of transparency, and structure. Variations in these properties produce different kinds of luster, whereas variations in the quantity of reflected light produce different intensities of the same luster. \n",

    "### Hardness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardness is a measure of how easily a mineral can be scratched. Hardness can be measured by a scratch test using the \"Moh’s Scale of Hardness\". Minerals are ranked out of 10, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the hardest. We have provided a set of 9 minerals (diamond is ranked at 10, so we have left this mineral out) ranked 1 through 9 on the Moh’s Scale of Hardness. Below we have provided a list of minerals that correspond to different levels of hardness. \n",

    "### Density:\n",
    "\n",
    "Density is a measure of a mineral's mass divided by its volume. This property is always the same. We have set up an experiment, similar to the classic Archimedes bathtub experiment, which allows accurate measurements of the density of solids. \n",

    "### Streak:\n",
    "\n",
    "Streak is the color of a mineral’s powder. Place the streak plate on a table and scratch the mineral across the plate. You may have to scratch hard to see the color. The harder the mineral, the harder you will have to scratch. Often the streak of a mineral is not unique enough to assist in mineral identification. Other times, the streak is very distinctive.\n",

    "Acid Reactions: Reaction to acids, typically dilute hydrochloric acid (~ 0.25 HCl), is a property that can be used to help identify some common minerals.

    "### Magnetism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several minerals react when placed within a magnetic field. Some minerals are strongly attracted to the magnet (Ferromagnetism), others are weakly attracted (Paramagnetism), and one mineral is actually repelled (Diamagnetism). In most cases, the presence of the element iron (Fe) as a component of the mineral's chemical structure is responsible for its magnetic properties.\n",
