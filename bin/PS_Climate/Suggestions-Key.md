**WAYS TO IMPROVE**

Benthic stack:
- High resolution global benthic stack for the last glacial cycle [Lisiecki and Stern 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016PA003002)
- Global benthic stack for the last 5.5 Ma [Lisiecki and Raymo 2005](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/5847)

Ice core data:
- Antarctic 800 Kyr Co2 data [Beteiter et al](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/17975)
- [Links](https://www.co2.earth/co2-ice-core-data) to more CO2 Ice core data sets for 1Kyr, 400 Kyr and 650 Kyr

Modern measurements
- [Muana Loa](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html) Co2 data from 1958 to 2022
- There are also data for [CH4](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/), [N20](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_n2o/) and [SF6](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_sf6/) as well/


There is a textbook by Bill Ruddiman called [Earth’s Climate](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Earths-Climate/p/1429255250?selected_tab=Contents). He has two chapters specifically on solid earth and climate—one on CO2 and Long-term climate (relating to the CO2 emitted from volcanoes versus CO2 removed by rock weathering) and one on Plate Tectonics and Climate (relating to how the position of the continents can affect Earth’s radiation balance—for instance during the Snowball Earth events, it is thought the supercontinent being mostly at low latitudes may have made earth colder by reflecting more solar radiation than ocean does).

In terms of data to use, the Milankovich seasonal solar insolation data is good to look at in terms of finding the frequencies of Earth’s orbital variations, but in general that’s used more to understand the short term climate changes (like glacial-interglacial cycle) that doesn’t involve the solid earth as much.

Another possibility to use the [Geocarb model](http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/geocarb/geocarb.doc.html) which was developed to think about how CO2 changed with changing in plate spreading rates, etc.
