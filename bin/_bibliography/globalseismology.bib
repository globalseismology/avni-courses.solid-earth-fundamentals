	abstract = {{Reconciliation of techniques, models and data has emerged as a frontier area for deep Earth exploration. Past results have proven indispensable for assessing earthquake hazard, characterizing plate tectonics, elucidating material properties under extreme conditions, imaging interior structure, and as a general reference in other fields. We present advancements on a three-dimensional reference Earth model (REM3D) that captures the consensus view of heterogeneity in the mantle. Progress in modeling the Earth’s interior is driven by diverse data, ranging from astronomic-geodetic constraints to full seismic waveforms and derivative measurements of body waves (~ 1 – 20s), surface waves (~ 20 – 300s) and normal modes (~ 250 – 3000s). Reconciliation of data involves retrieving the missing metadata, archiving in scalable storage formats, documenting outliers indicative of the limitations in some techniques, and quantifying summary reference data with uncertainties. Building on our recent work on reference surface-wave dispersion datasets, arrival times of primary, diffracted, and reflected phases from the transition-zone and deeper discontinuities are reconciled for a body-wave reference dataset. This procedure involves revised techniques and archival formats for the processing of frequency-dependent arrival times. A revised dataset of normal-mode eigenfrequencies, quality factors and splitting is reconciled with updated uncertainties based on inter-catalog consistencies. Full-spectrum tomography uses these diverse observations to constrain physical properties – seismic velocity, anisotropy, density, attenuation and the topography of discontinuities – in variable spatial resolution. This technique is expanded to include long-wavelength geoid as an additional constraint on density variations. All geoscience workflows typically involve querying data or models in order to make inferences. Analysis and Visualization toolkit for plaNetary Inferences (AVNI) is a web-based software environment powered by Python that facilitates these computational workflows. AVNI tools are web-based so that the shared resources are accessed by authenticated users through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), without the overhead of storing data, compiling and running intensive codes.}},

@article{Moulik:2016cn,
	abstract = {Abstract A large data set of surface wave phase anomalies, body wave travel times, normal-mode splitting functions, and long-period waveforms is used to investigate the scaling between shear velocity, density, and compressional velocity in the Earth's mantle. We introduce a methodology that allows construction of joint models with various levels of scaling complexity, in order to detect seismological signatures of chemical heterogeneity. We demonstrate that the data sets considered cannot be fit concurrently with a uniform or a positive and uniform throughout the mantle. The variance reductions to P wave travel times and vP-sensitive modes are up to 40\% higher with our preferred model of anisotropic shear and compressional velocity than the recent anisotropic shear velocity model S362ANI+M, which was constructed assuming a uniform ν throughout the mantle. Several features reported in earlier tomographic studies persist after the inclusion of new and larger data sets; anticorrelation between bulk sound and shear velocities in the lowermost mantle as well as an increase in ν with depth in the lower mantle are largely independent of the regularization scheme. When correlations between density and shear velocity variations are imposed in the lowermost mantle, variance reductions of several spheroidal and toroidal modes deteriorate by as much as 40\%. Recent measurements of the splitting of 0S2, in particular, are largely incompatible with perfectly correlated shear velocity and density heterogeneity throughout the mantle. A way to significantly improve the fits to various data sets is by allowing independent density perturbations in the lowermost mantle. Our preferred joint model consists of denser-than-average anomalies (<1\% peak to peak) at the base of the mantle roughly coincident with the low-velocity superplumes. The relative variation of shear velocity, density, and compressional velocity in our study disfavors a purely thermal contribution to heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle, with implications for the long-term stability and evolution of superplumes.},

	abstract = {{Earth's solid interior harbors the long-term memory of unending transformations, such as the formation and evolution of heterogeneous domains in the mantle. These dynamic transformations operate on regions that differ in their spatial wavelengths, depth ranges and lateral extents. Seismic tomography uses waves generated by earthquakes to image the interior at global (nominal resolution > 1000 km), regional (~ 500-1000 km) and local scales (< 500 km). While spectra for global VS variations are dominated by their large-scale components, regional and VP and VS spectra beneath North America have not been quantified. We analyze, learn and assimilate consistent features in the upper mantle to create a large multiscale suite with uncertainties (ATLAS3D). Our infrastructure continuously learns from the burgeoning datasets and the deluge of Earth models in the community. Multiscale models transcend spatial scales to characterize geodynamic processes (e.g. mantle mixing) and underlying causes of heterogeneity (e.g. sinking slabs, volcanism). Our approach for creating the ATLAS3D model suite leverages prior knowledge using physics-informed machine learning (PIML) and Bayesian inference. We reconcile features globally and beneath North America through: (1) analysis of features extracted using a multiscale wavelet method, (2) learning spatial- and scale-dependent blind spots based on existing models, (3) assimilating consistent features for a large suite of multiscale models, and (4) formulating a cascading validation scheme for rejecting scenarios based on agreement with data. Validation is against the vast amount of data products contributed by the community to the reference Earth model (REM3D) project. Derived datasets include attributes of body waves (~ 1-20 s), surface waves (~ 20-300 s) and normal modes (~ 250-3300 s), typically employed in Full Spectrum Tomography. Validation also uses the band-limited waveforms (~ 17-250 s) utilized in Adjoint Tomography using the Spectral Element Method. By coupling derived and processed waveform observations with predictions for arbitrary multiscale models, our results are useful for identifying regions of scientific interest, validating new techniques, planning future seismic deployments, and testing hypotheses about the Earth?s interior.}},

    abstract  ={{Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity's most pressing current and future challenges. The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field.\n\nA Framework for K-12 Science Education outlines a broad set of expectations for students in science and engineering in grades K-12. These expectations will inform the development of new standards for K-12 science education and, subsequently, revisions to curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development for educators. This book identifies three dimensions that convey the core ideas and practices around which science and engineering education in these grades should be built. These three dimensions are: crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science through their common application across science and engineering; scientific and engineering practices; and disciplinary core ideas in the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences and for engineering, technology, and the applications of science. The overarching goal is for all high school graduates to have sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be careful consumers of scientific and technical information, and enter the careers of their choice.\n\nA Framework for K-12 Science Education is the first step in a process that can inform state-level decisions and achieve a research-grounded basis for improving science instruction and learning across the country. The book will guide standards developers, teachers, curriculum designers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, and educators who teach science in informal environments.}},
