    "Tectonic earthquake typically involve shear motion along a fault, in which  the two sides of the fault move sideways against one another.  This is very efficient at generating S-waves which involve motion perpendicular to the wave propagation direction.  Earthquake seismograms typically show weak P-waves and strong S-waves.   Explosions however, involve motion outward/inward from the source in all directions without shear motion.  Explosion seismograms typically show strong P-waves and indistinct S-waves.  See the example below (from the March 2009 issue of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory's Science and Technology Review):\n",
