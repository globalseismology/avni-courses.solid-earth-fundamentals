Jupyter Book is an open-source tool for building publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

Jupyter Book allows users to

* write their content in [markdown files](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks,
* include computational elements (e.g., code cells) in either type,
* include rich syntax such as citations, cross-references, and numbered equations, and
* using a simple command, run the embedded code cells, [cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) the outputs and convert this content into:
    * a web-based interactive book and
    * a publication-quality PDF.
