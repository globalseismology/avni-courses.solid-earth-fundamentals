This website hosts the interactive book, *Fundamentals of Solid Earth Science*, which offers an introduction to a smorgasbord of introductory topics using the Python programming language. The content is specifically designed for people interested in geoscience education using some of the latest computational tools. This website is part of the software ecosystem called **A**nalysis and **V**isualization toolkit for pla**N**etary **I**nferences (or **AVNI**), which provides free web-based and backend code access to tools, techniques, models and data related to global solid Earth geosciences.

## More About AVNI

AVNI is a software ecosystem for analyzing and interpreting planetary models and
data sets that were initially designed or the three-dimensional reference Earth
model project [REM3D](http://rem3d.org). The codes are primary written in Python
with interfaces to legacy routines in C and Fortran. Some installation files as
well as applets and API access require registration on the AVNI Homepage below.

**Frequently Asked Questions**:
[FAQ](http://avni.globalseismology.org/stable/overview/faq.html)

A core team maintains the public repository and releases versions after
benchmarking; if you do not see activity on Github, that does not mean
improvements or bug fixes are not underway! We provide APIs that interface with
heavy, legacy codes hosted our servers so that AVNI installation remains light
to serve various applications. Contact the AVNI team at
**avni@globalseismology.org** with any questions or suggestions.
