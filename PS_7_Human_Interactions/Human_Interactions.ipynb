    "## Part II: The Parkfield Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that the general observation that earthquakes recur on individual faults can be the result of many physical realities. The simple ‘sawtooth’ earthquake cycle model may be attractive because of its simplicity, but its validity has to be confirmed by observational data. This model has come under a great deal of criticism lately, because its predictions for the locations of earthquakes over the past 20 years along the Pacific rim have not been very successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to illustrate how probabilistic forecasts are made by calculating the likely time for next Parkfield earthquake using statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Background*: The National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (NEPEC) in 1985 endorsed a prediction that with 95% confidence (= probability), the next Parkfield earthquake would occur\n",
    "before January 1993.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Data*: At the time, most seismologists agreed that earthquakes of very similar size and character (that is, which ruptured the same part of the San Andreas Fault) have occurred near Parkfield at the following times: 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966. There is no record of earthquake activity before 1857, but we do not expect there to be one because the area was not settled at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate expectations and probabilities, you have to have a model in mind which tells you what the data above represent. It is not clear which model is most appropriate, and you may think of a better one than the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Approach 1 — strictly numbers.* The sequence clearly suggests a repetition with approximately the same interval between events. If we think of the intervals between earthquakes as belonging to a normal distribution with some mean, the data can be used to estimate both an average repeat time and a standard deviation around that mean."

    "\n",
    "From a human perspective, earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater along the North American/Pacific plate boundary in California are rare.  But as the prelab assignment shows, they do occur and when they do, they can cause devastating injury, loss of life, and property destruction. \n",
    " \n",
    "How do we determine the probability of such events, in a way that is useful to guide earthquake awareness and preparedness?  What is the basis for earthquake probability maps such as the one presented here?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to estimate the likely of large earthquake occurring within a particular area over a specified period of time is to calculate a probability based on the occurrence of smaller earthquakes in that area. This method assumes that the events are independent of one another, hereas elastic rebound theory holds that after a fault ruptures, it takes time for tectonic stress to re-accumulate on that fault.  The **Third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3)** includes this notion of fault “readiness” in its earthquake forecast, as well as probabilities based on the frequency of small earthquakes. For further background see [https://www.scec.org/ucerf](https://www.scec.org/ucerf).\n",
