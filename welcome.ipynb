    "This website hosts the interactive book, *Fundamentals of Solid Earth Science*, which offers an introduction to a smorgasbord of introductory topics using the Python programming language. The content is specifically designed for people interested in geoscience education using some of the latest computational tools.\n",

    "**What is Solid Earth Science?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This book provides a quantitative introduction to the geosciences, focusing on the *physical*, *chemical*, and *biological* processes that created and continually influence the habitable conditions on our planet. Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, surface & interior form a coupled system, interacting through processes that operate over a wide range of spatial & temporal scales. Various physical, chemical & biological processes, such as meteorite impacts, glaciation & erosion, erase the geological memory of Earth’s outermost layers. The solid interior, in contrast, harbors the long-term memory of transformations that shape our planet. These include accretion & the evolution of the crust, mantle & core through differentiation, plate tectonics, climate change & anthropogenic forcing. Human interactions with the solid interior include extraction of natural resources and engineering to mitigate the effects of environmental risks and disasters. We will end with the evolution of life and climate, long-term transformations that are either recorded by or have feedbacks with the solid Earth.\n",
