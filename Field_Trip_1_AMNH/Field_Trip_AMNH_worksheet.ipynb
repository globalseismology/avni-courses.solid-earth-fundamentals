    "Welcome to the *Central Park* in New York City!\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Park was the first landscaped public park in the United States. An irregular terrain of swamps and bluffs, punctuated by rocky outcrops, made the land between Fifth and Eighth avenues and 59<sup>th</sup> and 106<sup>th</sup> streets undesirable for private development. The building of Central Park was one of nineteenth-century New York’s most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers reshaped the topography to create the pastoral landscape. The park first opened for public use in the winter of 1859. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it a widespread and persistent myth that Central Park is entirely artificial. The rocky outcrops in Central Park belong to a rock unit named the Manhattan Formation. Much of the Manhattan Formation is a metamorphic rock called *schist* and is quite pretty since it's primarily composed of flakes of *mica* which reflect sunlight creating a sparkly rock. The durable Manhattan schist that runs down the island's spine got its start about 450 million years ago as soft mud on an ancient seafloor. The sediments, compressed into metamorphic rock, were folded and forced to the surface by collisions of continents. \n",
    "\n",
    "These often hidden rock layers provide a fine foundation for the city's skyscrapers. In fact, it is because the bedrock is so close to the surface in many areas of Manhattan that the city can so easily support and anchor our towering skyscrapers. In other places, it is much more difficult to drill down to the bedrock and anchor the foundation of these huge buildings. Let us go to three stops representing the geological evolution of Manhattan, which laid the groundwork for this center of human civilization! "

About 15 thousand years ago, a giant body of flowing ice (a glacier) covered this area. Embedded in the ice at the bottom of the glacier were large boulders. As the ice pressed down on these boulders and dragged them over the underlying bedrock, grooves were carved in the bedrock. Smaller particles of rock that were dragged along created smaller grooves called **striations**.\n",
