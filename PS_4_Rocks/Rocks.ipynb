    "# Part I: Rock Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "A rock is a material made up of one or more different minerals. That is why an essential part of rock identification is the ability to correctly recognize the major (or most abundant) minerals within a given rock sample. This is often described as the rock’s mineralogy, or **composition**. Another important component in rock identification is to correctly interpret the rock **texture**. Texture is the size, shape, and grain-to-grain relationships between minerals in a rock. All rocks can be placed into one of three major rock groups based on their texture; igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic rocks. Recognition of both composition and texture allows one to assign an appropriate rock name. \n",
    "\n",
    "### TO DO\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1:** Each table has been given a set of rocks that are among the most common in the Earth's crust. Your goal is to identify each rock by assessing its composition and texture. We have provided rock identification flow charts that list common rock types and a set of corresponding compositional and textural properties. \n",

    "\n",
    "![Metamorphic_Rocks.png](Photos/Metamorphic_Rocks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified your rocks, place each of your samples in their proper locations on the flow chart. **Take a photo of it, upload it to Adroit, and link it in your Jupyter notebook below.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: An extra set of samples and the rock charts will be left outside our precept room if you need more time to look at the samples. Also, if your uploaded image does not get exported to PDF, please append the image to your PDF submission with Adobe Reader or Mac Preview software."

    "that layering might also make the rock more susceptible to breaking apart due to freeze-thaw\n",
    "cycles. Or, if the rock you are considering is very beautiful, you might be willing to compromise\n",
    "on other characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strength**: able to withstand the required load.\n",
    "2. **Cost effective**: abundant, nearby, easy to transport to the building site\n",
    "3. **Aesthetics**: attractive and interesting without polishing or other costly finishing techniques.\n",
    "4. **Resistant to chemical and physical weathering:** marble and limestone, being comprised of calcite, are susceptible to chemical weathering (dissolution) by the mildly acidic nature of rainwater. Quartz-rich rocks would be less so. Rocks most resistant to water infiltration would be fine-grained, crystalline rocks with low porosity and no cracks, no layering or other planes of weakness.\n",
    "5. **Ease of usage**: Rocks comprised of calcite are easily shaped with steel tools, silica-rich rocks would need diamond-embedded saws. If the rock naturally breaks into building block shaped pieces, less shaping needs to be done at the site."

    "\n",
    "In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. The goal of segmenting an image is to change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. It is usually used for locating objects and creating boundaries. For crystalline igneous rocks with overlapping grains, finding the boundaries of individual grains is sometimes not tractable. You can check this by running the mini-tutorial from *Image Processing A* with the rock in *Image Processing B*. See if you get well defined grains!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to partition the image is by characterizing the distribution of individual minerals based on the color. Color is denoted by the tuple (R,G,B) denoting the RGB color model. This additive color model uses red, green, and blue as primary colors of light that are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) to identify similar grouping of a set of pixels in such a way that the pixels in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). In an ideal scenario, each of these clusters corresponds to a single mineral in the rock. Overall, applying K-means yields `K` separate clusters of the original `n` data points. Given a `MxN` size image, we have `MxN` pixels, each consisting of three components: Red, Green, and Blue respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat of K-means is that we need to specify the number of clusters we want to generate ahead of time (4 minerals in our case). There are algorithms that automatically select the optimal value of K, but these algorithms are outside the scope of this problem set. Let's see how K-means cluster works as it tries to find the most optimal groups of points on a 2-D plane below over several iterations:"

Running the clustering algorithm should add another column called *prediction* to the same file. "
